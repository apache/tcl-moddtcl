Test Suite for mod_dtcl

$Id$

These tests are intended to automate the testing of core mod_dtcl
features.  They are not complete at this point, and work on them would
be welcome.

How to run the tests:

Assuming you have a system which runs mod_dtcl, put the dtcl-test.ttml
file somewhere under your document root, and modify this line:

set urlbase "http://localhost/"

to something like

set urlbase "http://path.to.testfile.com/mytests/"

Then run dtcl.test, and look and see if any of the tests fail.

To do:

* Security review: I would like someone with security background to
  thoroughly go over the code.

* Script timeouts: set limits on the length of time a script will run
  before it returns or dies.

* General resource limits?

* More commands available for scripters (see PHP for examples).

* File uploads.  This is tricky, but necessary.

* Possible configuration options: possible safe mode.

* Further internationalization (multibyte languages such as Japanese).

* Nicer logo - artists welcome!

Random ideas and thoughts about the future:

* mod_tcl - hooks for everything in Tcl - so that you can write Apache
  modules in Tcl, and control every aspect of Apache from Tcl.

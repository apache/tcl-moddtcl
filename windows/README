Two sets of files are included here, from two attempts to make
mod_dtcl work under windows.

Jan Nijtman succesfully compiled mod_dtcl with VC++ 5, but says "I
never got to the point that it actually runs on Windows".  See
README.vc++.

Craig Huckabee has succesfully compiled and run mod_dtcl using the
MingW32 environment.  Instructions in README.mingw32.

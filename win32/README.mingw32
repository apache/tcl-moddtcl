Steps for building mod_dtcl under NT for Apache with MingW32 (http://www.mingw.org/). 1)  Get Apache for NT/2000, I used version 1.3.X.  You can use the binary release or build it from source.  I built from source because I needed to also includemod_ssl.  Note that I used VC++ to build Apache - they don't support MingW32 yet AFAIK.2) Edit the win32\makefile in the mod_dtcl source tree to reflect your environment, i.e. where is Tcl installed, where is Apache installed, whereare your Apache sources and object files, etc.3)  Apply the diffs for Apache.  The diff for Apache wraps a few declarations and one #include directive in the os.h file that aren't needed or used with the MingW32 compiler.  I used GNU patch to do this with :	patch -c -b < os.h.diff

    NOTE: This patch may not apply cleanly as this file has changed in each revision of
	  Apache.  What the patch does is pretty obvious so it can be applied by hand if
	  needed.4)  Run make.  There will be some warnings about a redefinition - you can ignore it. You should be left with a file called ApacheModuleDtcl.dll.If you are using Apache 1.3.17 or newer that uses .so files for modules, you canrun 'make so_style' to get a mod_dtcl.so.  Or you can simply rename the dll :)   5)  Run make install.  Make the changes to your Apache configuration as described on the mod_dtcl documentation, and you are off.Notes :	-- Tcl needs to be in the path of the web server	-- These instructions assume you have the MingW32 gcc setup as well 	   as a good collection of GNU tools on your NT machine (sed, grep, etc).	   They also assume you have Tcl setup.  	-- You will need a fairly recent version of the MingW32 toolset and the 	   associated win32api fileset - see http://www.mingw.org for details on 	   obtaining new releases.	-- I've tried my best to make these instructions error free but	   mistakes are possible.  Good Luck,Craig
